FinGuard AI is a FinOps control-plane system that predicts and prevents cloud cost explosions before they occur.

## Problem
Cloud cost overruns are usually discovered after the bill arrives.

## Solution
FinGuard AI intercepts cloud infrastructure events, predicts cost impact, and enforces cost policies in real time.

## MVP Goal
Detect deployment → predict cost → warn or block risky actions.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI backend
- Streamlit dashboard
- ML-based cost prediction
